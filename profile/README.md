# Welcome to David'Org

Hello! I am Dai Weijian.

I am now studing in University of Hong Kong for my masterâ€™s degree.

For my hobbies, I am really into playing computer games, such as League of Legends, PUBG, and so on. If you are also interested in such game, we could play together!

I am too shy to share my photo here, Let me just share my lovely cat picture.
